# Teeview Analytics Bot

The purpose of this project is to create a bot along with an analytics tool that notifies us in near real-time of potentially successful campaigns in order to draw our attention to it before the market becomes saturated. More importantly than the notification capability is the ability of the tool to identify potentially successfull campaigns through the calculation of pointwise velocity and acceleration of the campaign.
